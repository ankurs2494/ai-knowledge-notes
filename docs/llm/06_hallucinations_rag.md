# Understanding Hallucination in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines **retrieval of information** from external sources with **language model generation**. While powerful, RAG systems can sometimes produce **hallucinations**, meaning the model generates information that is **plausible but false**.

This guide explains hallucination in RAG at **beginner**, **intermediate**, and **advanced** levels, with examples and use cases.

## 1. Beginner Level

### What is RAG?

RAG is a model architecture that works in two steps:

1. **Retrieval:** Fetch relevant documents from a database, knowledge base, or the internet.
2. **Generation:** Generate an answer using the retrieved documents along with the model's internal knowledge.

**Example:**

- **Query:** "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020?"
- **Retrieved Document:** Article mentioning Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez.
- **Generated Answer:** "The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020 was awarded to Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez."

### What is Hallucination?

- **Hallucination** occurs when the model generates information **not supported by the retrieved documents**.
- This happens because the model tries to "fill in gaps" based on its internal knowledge or patterns, even when the retrieved data does not support it.

**Simple Example:**

- **Query:** "What is the capital of Atlantis?"
- **Retrieved Document:** None (Atlantis is fictional)
- **Hallucinated Answer:** "The capital of Atlantis is Poseidon City." ✅ False!

## 2. Intermediate Level

### Why Does Hallucination Happen in RAG?

1. **Insufficient Retrieval:** The retrieved documents may not contain the needed information.
2. **Over-reliance on LM Knowledge:** The model may ignore the retrieval and generate plausible-sounding but incorrect facts.
3. **Ambiguous Queries:** The question may be vague, leading the model to guess.
4. **Conflicting Sources:** Retrieved documents may contain inconsistent information.

### Example

- **Query:** "Who invented the Internet?"
- **Retrieved Docs:** 
  - Doc1: Mentions Tim Berners-Lee (invented the World Wide Web)
  - Doc2: Mentions Vint Cerf (worked on TCP/IP)
- **Hallucinated Answer:** "Tim Berners-Lee invented the Internet." ❌ Incorrect (he invented the Web, not the Internet).

### Use Cases Where Hallucination is Critical

- **Medical Advice Systems:** Hallucinations can lead to dangerous misinformation.
- **Legal Document Generation:** False citations could be legally problematic.
- **Customer Support:** Hallucinated instructions may confuse users.

### Hallucination Detection and Mitigation

#### 3.1 Methods to Reduce Hallucination

1. **Better Retrieval**
   - Use **dense retrieval models** (e.g., **FAISS, Milvus**) to get more relevant documents.
   - Use **query expansion** to improve retrieval coverage.

2. **Fact-checking**
   - Cross-check generated answers with retrieved sources.
   - Implement **RAG with verification**: compare LM output with retrieved facts.

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Explicitly instruct the model:  
     `"Answer only based on the retrieved documents. Do not make up information."`

4. **Confidence Estimation**
   - Use models that provide a **likelihood score** or **uncertainty estimate**.
   - Flag low-confidence outputs for human review.

#### 3.2 Advanced Example

- **Query:** "Explain how CRISPR works."
- **Retrieved Docs:** Scientific articles on CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism.
- **Hallucination Risk:** The LM might say: "CRISPR can edit RNA directly," which is false in the retrieved context (it edits DNA).
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Compare output against the retrieved scientific articles.
  - Correct the output using **RAG with grounding**.

### Applications

- **Enterprise Knowledge Management:** Answer employee questions using internal docs without hallucination.
- **Scientific Research Assistance:** Generate literature summaries that are factually grounded.
- **Conversational AI:** Reduce false statements in chatbots by grounding answers in trusted sources.

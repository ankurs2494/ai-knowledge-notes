IP Addresses (The Heart of Networking)

What is an IP Address?
    An IP address is a logical identifier that tells the network:
        ○ Who you are
        ○ Where you are
    
Example:
    192.168.1.10
Think of it like:
    • Country → City → Street → House number

IPv4 Basics
    
    IPv4 looks like this:
        A.B.C.D
    Each number:
        ○ Range: 0–255
        ○ Called an octet
        ○ 4 octets = 32 bits
    
    Example:
        192.168.1.10

Public vs Private IP Addresses

    ¯ Private IPs (Used inside networks)

        ○ 10.0.0.0/8
        ○ 172.16.0.0/12
        ○ 192.168.0.0/16
    
    Used in:
        ○ Home networks
        ○ Office networks
        ○ Cloud VPCs
    
    These:
        ○ Are reused everywhere
        ○ Exist in millions of networks simultaneously
        
    
    ¯ Public IPs (Internet-facing)
    
        ○ Globally unique
        ○ Assigned by ISP / Cloud provider
        ○ Known and routable across the internet
        
        
💡 Private IPs cannot be reached directly from the internet.

Loopback Address

    127.0.0.1
    Means:
        “This host talking to itself”
    Used for:
        ○ Testing
        ○ Local services

    v  Learn Subnetting (Don’t Fear It)
============================================================================================================

What Is a Subnet?

    Simple definition:
        A subnet is a logical grouping of IP addresses.
        
    Why it exists:
        ○ Organization
        ○ Security
        ○ Efficient routing
    
    Example subnet:
        192.168.1.0/24

Understanding CIDR (/24, /16, etc.)

    CIDR tells:
        How much of the IP is the network vs the host
        
    Example:
    192.168.1.0/24
        ○ /24 = first 24 bits are network
        ○ Remaining bits = hosts

CIDR Sizes You MUST Know
    
    

👉 You don’t need more at beginner level.

Network IP vs Host IP
    
    192.168.1.0/24
    
        ○ 192.168.1.0 → Network address
        ○ 192.168.1.255 → Broadcast
        ○ 192.168.1.1–254 → Usable hosts

====================================
    v Default Gateway (Very Important)
====================================

    What is it?
        The router your host uses to reach other networks.
            
        If your host wants to reach:
            § Same subnet → direct
            § Different subnet → send to gateway
            
        Example:
        IP: 192.168.1.10
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
    
    Mental Model (Lock This In)
    
        Host → Gateway → Internet → Gateway → Host

        No gateway = no internet.


The internet is a global network.

For it to work:

    • Every device on the internet must have a unique address
    • Routers must know where to send traffic
    • Internet Routers Drop Private IP Traffic. Why?
        ○ It cannot route private IP ranges
        ○ Those ranges are explicitly reserved for internal use
    


====================================
    v  How Two Hosts Communicate (Simple)
====================================

    Same subnet:
        ○ 192.168.1.10 → 192.168.1.20
        ○ Direct communication.
    
    Different subnet:
        ○ 192.168.1.10 → 8.8.8.8
        ○ Goes through gateway.


 Cloud Example (AWS/Azure/GCP)

        ○ Private subnet → ❌ No internet
        ○ Private subnet + NAT Gateway → ✅ Internet access
        ○ Public subnet + Internet Gateway → ✅ Internet access
    
    Same rule everywhere.


🧠 Key Rules to Remember Forever

    1️⃣ IP = identity + location
    2️⃣ Subnet = group of IPs
    3️⃣ Gateway = exit door
    4️⃣ Private IP ≠ Internet reachable
    5️⃣ Loopback = self

✅ Check Your Understanding

You should confidently answer:

    • What is an IP address?
    • Difference between public and private IP?
    • What does /24 mean?
    • What is a gateway?
    • Why can’t private IPs access internet directly?
        ○ Private IPs are not globally unique and are not routable on the public internet.
        ○ NAT is required to translate them into public IPs.

## 📚 Knowledge Base – LLMs, Agentic AI & DevOps

Welcome to my personal knowledge repository focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI, DevOps automation, and system design fundamentals.

# This repository is built for:

- Structured learning
- Interview preparation
- Real-world system understanding
- Long-term reference

### 🧠 Topics Covered

## 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)

- How LLMs work internally
- Tokens, embeddings, transformers
- Attention mechanism
- Training, fine-tuning, RLHF
- Inference, sampling, hallucinations
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 2. Agentic AI

- What are AI agents
- Tool usage, memory, planning
- Agent orchestration (LangGraph, CrewAI)
- DevOps & ITSM agents

## 3. Vector Databases
- Embeddings and semantic search
- FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone
- RAG pipelines and architecture

## 4. DevOps + AI
- AI-driven operations
- Monitoring & automation
- Security best practices
- Cloud & infrastructure use cases

## 5. System Design
- Caching strategies
- Cache invalidation
- Redis vs Memcached
- Scalability patterns

## 6. Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / Bedrock
- LangChain / LangGraph
- Vector Databases
- Docker
- FastAPI

##  Goal of This Repository

Build deep understanding of how modern AI systems work internally and how to apply them safely and effectively in real-world systems.
